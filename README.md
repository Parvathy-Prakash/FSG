This code implements a Canteen Food Alert System that tracks and manages food levels in a canteen. It consists of the following key features:

Food Level Display: Shows the current food percentage (starting at 100%).
Status Indicator: Changes color and message based on food level (green for abundant, yellow for moderate, red for low).
Control Buttons:
Serve Food: Decreases food level by 10% or 5%.
Refill Food: Resets food level to 100%.
Notifications: Alerts users when food levels drop below thresholds (70%, 30%, 15%) and when food is refilled.
Notification History: Displays past alerts with timestamps.
Smooth Transitions: Notifications fade in and out, and the status indicator color changes smoothly.
JavaScript Functions:
Update food levels and status.
Trigger notifications based on food level changes.
Track and display notification history.
Overall, the system helps monitor food availability, alert users when supplies are low, and track actions taken to manage food levels.
